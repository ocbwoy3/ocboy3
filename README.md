## please read me
I develop stuff.
I am currently trying to make a bloxbiz ripoff because their ads were TOO EXPENSIVE (i need ads for [unbox a computer](https://www.roblox.com/games/7404243423/Voice-Chat-Unbox-a-Computer))
Unbox a computer has stopped in development because no support. (give help please)
And now I make unbox a computer 2 game with multi pc support and plug and play just like OpenComputers 

E-Chatting is better than all the other chat apps
